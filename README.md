## Overview

I've coded my first website where you can see my work as a developer. It is important to mention that I developed my website watching the video embedded in this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-portfolio-website-using-html-css-javascript/) and then I decided to make my own modifications. You can see the original project [here](https://github.com/mendibox/newbie-portfolio).

I will be adding, removing and experimenting with this project since I pretend to make it my first way of contact and showcase my journey as a developer.
Of course, you are always free to clone and replicate this site.
